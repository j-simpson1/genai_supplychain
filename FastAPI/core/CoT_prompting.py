Q: What is the supply chain structure for the braking system of the Toyota RAV4?
A: The braking system consists of key components: brake pads, rotors, calipers, and control units.
Each component has suppliers: Germany supplies pads and discs, Denmark supplies calipers, Belgium supplies accessories.
Toyota uses a Just-In-Time model, so suppliers deliver parts directly to the assembly line with minimal inventory.
The answer is: multi-tiered supply chain with key suppliers in Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, supporting Toyota’s JIT manufacturing.

Q: Which component makes up the largest share by value of the braking system? 
A: The total cost of the braking system is £614.38, with the most expensive part being the brake calliper, which costs 
£72.64 and requires a quantity of 4. Proportion of total cost = part cost / total component cost. For the brake 
calliper, this equates to (£72.64 x 4) / £614.38 = 51.2%. The answer is: Brake callipers make up 51.2% of the total 
cost of the component, with an average cost of £72.64 per unit.

Q: What risks does Toyota face in its braking system supply chain, and how can it mitigate them?
A: Car supply chains face risks from single-source suppliers, critical material shortages (e.g., rare earths, 
semiconductors), and tariff or geopolitical disruptions that can halt production. The answer is: diversifying 
suppliers, building strategic inventories, and utilising real-time risk monitoring and scenario planning to enhance 
resilience.
