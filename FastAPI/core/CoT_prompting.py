Q: What is the supply chain structure for the powertrain system of the Honda CR-V?
A: The powertrain includes the engine block, transmission, control units, and exhaust system.
Key suppliers: Japan is the leading supplier of engine block, South Korea supplies transmission components, and the 
United States supplies control modules. Honda follows a Just-In-Time (JIT) approach, meaning suppliers deliver 
components directly to assembly plants with minimal warehousing. 
The answer is: a multi-tiered supply chain with critical suppliers in Japan, South Korea, and the United States, all 
integrated within Honda’s JIT production model.

Q: Which component represents the highest value share in the powertrain system? 
A: The total cost of the powertrain system is £1,245.60, and the transmission assembly is the most expensive part, 
costing £310.50 each, with two units required per vehicle. Proportion of total cost = (part cost × quantity) / total 
cost = (£310.50 × 2) / £1,245.60 = 49.8%. 
The answer is: Transmission assemblies account for 49.8% of the total system cost, at £310.50 per unit.

Q: What risks does Honda face in its powertrain supply chain, and how can these risks be mitigated?
A: Automotive supply chains are exposed to risks such as dependency on single suppliers, fluctuating raw material 
prices (e.g., steel, rare earths), and geopolitical or tariff disruptions affecting cross-border shipping. 
The answer is: mitigating these risks by diversifying supplier networks, securing backup logistics routes, maintaining 
strategic inventory reserves, and utilising digital supply chain monitoring to enhance resilience.
