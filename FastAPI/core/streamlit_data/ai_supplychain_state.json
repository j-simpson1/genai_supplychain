Key origins include Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. A tariff shock simulation applies three UK import duty rates\u201410%, 30% and 60%\u2014and factors in a 20% VAT, revealing no cost escalation under any scenario. The most valuable component is the brake caliper mounting, representing 52.5% of system cost. Despite full tariff exposure (6/6 parts), the duty hikes yield a negligible 0.0% increase in landed cost. Strategic recommendations focus on supplier diversification, bonded logistics, real-time digital monitoring and long-term contracting to bolster resilience against future trade disruptions.\",\n      \"figures\": [],\n      \"bullet_points\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"heading\": \"Key Points\",\n      \"content\": \"\",\n      \"figures\": [],\n      \"bullet_points\": [\n        \"Vehicle/component: Toyota RAV4 IV Braking System\",\n        \"Combined component price: \u00a3458.58 excl.
